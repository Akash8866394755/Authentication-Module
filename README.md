Finally i am design here authentication module base on my knowledge & at present i am learning server side programming language called PHP.
One benefit of server side programming languages is that they allow us to construct production-ready web applications. This is because using databases is necessary while using PHP. 
The PHP server side language and connectivity to the MySql database RDBMS software have a more suited interaction.
In this authentication project, users first register and provide basic information such as their full name, email address, and password. Once they have entered all of the relevant information about themselves, they are sent a six-digit profile activation code for further general security. In a different scenario, let's say a user forgets to enter the activation code for their Gmail account. When they attempt to log in, the login fails since the profile activation code was not entered when the user registered. When we enter an activation code in the database, the user's status changes to "active," and for those who have not entered an activation code, their status remains pending. This solution resolves the issue of failed login attempts.
I'm using technologies like HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, PHP, and MySQL in this project.
Nowadays, every developer advises against learning PHP because it is outdated. However, even though I am aware of this, I still chose to learn it because PHP is the only language better suited for web development—my coding career began with web development—and it has more features than other server-side programming languages.
